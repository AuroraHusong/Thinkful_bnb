Thinkfulbnb is a vacation rental website that allows people to rent out their homes to people who are seeking short-term accommodations similar to Airbnb. The user can enter their preference of property, including single rooms, apartments, and unique living spaces such as yachts, houseboats, yurts, tiny houses, and even renovated medieval castles.

This is an HTML and CSS application with an emphasis on a mobile-first development approach. Flexbox was used to achieve the desired layouts.
